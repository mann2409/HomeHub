# How to Select Build 9 for App Store Submission

## You're in the Right Place!

You're currently in the **Distribution** tab, which is correct. Here's how to select Build 9:

## Step 1: Find Version 1.0.1

1. Look at the left sidebar where it shows:
   - "iOS App" with a green checkmark
   - "1.0 Ready for Distribution"

2. **Click on "iOS App"** or the version number
   - This should expand/show version options

3. You need to either:
   - **Edit version 1.0** and change it to 1.0.1, OR
   - **Create a new version 1.0.1**

---

## Step 2: Create/Edit Version

### Option A: Edit Existing Version 1.0

1. Click on **"iOS App Version 1.0"** (the text in the main content area)
2. Or look for an **"Edit"** button near the version number
3. Change the version to **1.0.1**
4. Look for a **"Build"** section

### Option B: Create New Version

1. Look for a **"+"** button or **"Add Version"** button
2. Click it and select **"iOS"**
3. Enter version **1.0.1**
4. This will create a new version entry

## Step 3: Select Build 9

Once you're editing version 1.0.1:

1. Look for a section called **"Build"** or **"iOS Build"**
2. Click **"Select a build"** or **"Choose a build"**
3. You should see a list of available builds:
   - Build 9 (1.0.1 (9)) ✅ - Select this one!
   - Build 6 (1.0.1 (6))
   - Build 5 (1.0.1 (5))
   - etc.
4. **Select Build 9** and click **Done** or **Save**

## Alternative: Look for These Sections

In the Distribution/Version page, look for:

- **"Build"** section (usually near the top)
- **"iOS Build"** dropdown
- **"Select Build"** button
- **"Version Information"** section (contains build selector)

---

## If You Still Can't Find It

Try these:

1. **Click on the version number** "1.0" in the left sidebar
2. Look for **"App Store"** in the left sidebar (might be under "App Store" section)
3. Check if there's a **"Versions"** section in the left sidebar
4. Look for **"App Store"** tab at the top (next to Distribution/TestFlight)

---

## Quick Navigation Tips

- **Left Sidebar:** Look for sections like "App Store", "Versions", or expand "iOS App"
- **Main Content:** Look for "Build" section when viewing version details
- **Top Tabs:** Distribution, TestFlight, Xcode Cloud - the build selector might be in Distribution

## What You're Looking For

You need to find a place where you can:
1. See version 1.0.1 (or create it)
2. See a "Build" dropdown/selector
3. Select "1.0.1 (9)" from the list

Once you select Build 9, you can add "What's New" text and submit!
