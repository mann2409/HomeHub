## üîê Security Best Practices

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Firebase Authentication (secure)
- ‚úÖ Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ Firebase Firestore security rules (should be configured)

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Configure Firestore Security Rules** (if not done):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Family data accessible to family members
    match /families/{familyId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/families/$(familyId)/members/$(request.auth.uid));
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Remove hardcoded Firebase credentials** from firebase.ts:
   - Use only environment variables
   - Never commit actual API keys to public repos

3. **Enable Firebase App Check** (recommended):
   - Protects your Firebase resources from abuse

## üìß Sample Support/Privacy Contact
Create a dedicated email like:
- privacy@yourdomain.com
- support@yourdomain.com
- Or use your personal email
