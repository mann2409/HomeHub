```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "HomeHub",
    "slug": "homehub",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/splash.png",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#1A1B2E"
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.homehub",
      "buildNumber": "1",
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSCameraUsageDescription": "This app uses the camera to...",
        "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription": "This app accesses your photos to..."
      }
    },
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `com.yourcompany.homehub` with your unique bundle identifier.

---

### **STEP 2: Login to Expo Account**

Run in your terminal:

```bash
eas login
```

- If you don't have an Expo account, create one at https://expo.dev
- Enter your email and password when prompted

---

### **STEP 3: Configure EAS Build**

Initialize EAS in your project:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

This will create an `eas.json` file with build configurations.

---

### **STEP 4: Update eas.json Configuration**

Your `eas.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.2.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "ios": {
        "simulator": true
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false,
        "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.homehub"
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your.apple.id@email.com",
        "ascAppId": "YOUR_ASC_APP_ID",
        "appleTeamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
      }
    }
